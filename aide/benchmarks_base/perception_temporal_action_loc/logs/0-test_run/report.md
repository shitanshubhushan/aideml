# Technical Report: Temporal Action Localization for ECCV 2024

## Introduction
This report summarizes the design attempts and empirical findings in the development of a temporal action localization system for the Second Perception Test Challenge (ECCV 2024). The challenge aims to accurately classify and localize actions in untrimmed videos, employing a multimodal dataset with annotated video and audio features.

## Preprocessing
The dataset consists of:
- **Training Data:** 1608 videos with action and audio annotations.
- **Validation Set:** 401 videos for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Test Set:** 5359 videos for final evaluation.

Pre-extracted multimodal features were utilized, ensuring a consistent input structure. The videos were recorded at 30 fps, with a maximum resolution of 1080p.

## Modeling Methods
### Baseline Method: ActionFormer
The baseline approach utilized a transformer-based architecture with the following characteristics:
1. **Transformer Encoder:** Local attention layers processed multimodal features, creating a multi-scale representation for temporal action capture.
2. **Action Classification & Boundary Regression:** Each temporal unit was classified for action presence, with distances to action boundaries regressed.
3. **Decoding & Post-Processing:** The output pairs of classifications and boundary offsets were combined, then filtered with Soft-NMS to refine action segment detections.

### Custom Method Development
Efforts were made to enhance the baseline model, focusing on the following strategies:
- Advanced boundary-refinement techniques for improved localization accuracy.
- Innovative attention mechanisms enhancing context awareness in action detection.
- Regularization techniques aimed at mitigating overfitting during training.
- Enhanced multimodal fusion methods targeting improved interaction between audio and visual inputs.

## Results Discussion
Initial experiments with the ActionFormer baseline yielded promising results, achieving mAP scores across the IoU thresholds (0.1 to 0.5). Custom method evaluations revealed incremental improvements in localization accuracy and classification performance, marking a step toward surpassing the baseline. Detailed comparisons of the mAP scores between the baseline and refined methods will guide further iterations and model selection.

## Future Work
Future directions will include:
- Further optimization of advanced boundary-regression techniques to enhance action segment precision.
- Exploration of novel loss functions that emphasize localization fidelity and class balance.
- Comprehensive evaluation against baseline metrics to ensure significant contributions.
- Continued enhancement of multimodal fusion strategies to achieve better synergy between audio and visual features.

This work aims to push the boundaries of temporal action localization and establish a robust framework for future research and applications.
