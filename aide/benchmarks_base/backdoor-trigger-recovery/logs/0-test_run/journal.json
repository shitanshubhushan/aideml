The method iteratively generates candidate triggers by appending common programming keywords and phrases to the target strings, evaluating their effectiveness in eliciting the desired outputs. This approach aims to systematically explore potential trigger phrases while ensuring that the length constraint of 10 tokens is respected.","step":0,"id":"98aa04e78fd0443f957cd615674e2500","ctime":1746130274.6510127,"parent":null,"children":[],"_term_out":["Traceback (most recent call last):","  File \"/data2/sbhushan/aideml/aide/benchmarks_base/backdoor-trigger-recovery/workspaces/0-test_run/input/main.py\", line 20, in <module>","    loaded_methods = all_method_handlers()","  File \"/data2/sbhushan/aideml/aide/benchmarks_base/backdoor-trigger-recovery/env/methods/__init__.py\", line 7, in all_method_handlers","    \"llm_method\": LLMMethod,","NameError: name 'LLMMethod' is not defined.
